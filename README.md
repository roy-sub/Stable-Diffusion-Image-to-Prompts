# Stable-Diffusion-Image-to-Prompts

This repository contains code for the Text-to-Image Inversion Competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to develop a model that can predict the text prompt given a generated image, in order to understand how reversible the latent relationship is between prompts and images generated by Stable Diffusion 2.0.

## Project Details
The popularity of text-to-image models has created a need for prompt engineering in order to generate high-quality images. This competition challenges participants to reverse the typical direction of a generative text-to-image model by predicting the text prompt that generated a given image.

The dataset provided by Stable Diffusion 2.0 contains a wide variety of (prompt, image) pairs, and participants are expected to submit embeddings of their predicted prompts in order to calculate prompt similarity in a robust way.

## Deployment
The code for this project is currently under deployment and will be completed before the deadline of the competition. Stay tuned for updates and the final code submission.

Good luck to all participants!
